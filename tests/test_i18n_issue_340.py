"""Reproduces #340: more hardcoded / uncatalogued strings surviving the
#328/#310 sweep.

Two distinct failure modes, same as #328:

(a) literals never passed through gettext() at all (settings.html import
    cards, the reminders due-date line, the vehicle timeline titles in
    main.py) -- these can never be translated no matter the catalogue.
(b) strings that *are* wrapped in `_()` but whose msgid never made it into
    the shipped catalogues, so every non-English user just sees the English
    source text (Role, Photos, Restore May Backup, the Tires page).
